This code relies on:
- SIFT features for local features
- k-means for generation of the words via clustering
- SVM as classifier using the LIBSVM library

Following steps are to be followed:
1. Open terminal. 
1. Type chmod +x install_necessities to install the necessary libraries. 
2. Write ./install_necessities.
3. After this type chmod +x script.
4. And finally ./script.

The output will be available in the Used_dataset/test.
The dataset should have following structure, where all the images belonging to one class are in the same folder:

    .
    |-- path_to_folders_with_images
    |    |-- class1
    |    |-- class2
    |    |-- class3
    ...
    |    â””-- classN

The folder can have any name.
